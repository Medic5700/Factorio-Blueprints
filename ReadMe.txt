Generating Blueprint Images
    # Use a Discord bot from the Factorio Discord Server
    Factorio Discord Server -> 'Help' group channel -> '# bot-stuff'
        use '/blueprint custom file: show-background:true show-alt-mode:true show-grid-numbers:true' to upload a 'blueprint text file' to the bot
        Note: 'file' must go before options, otherwise options seem to be ignored
